# NYC-Property-Dataset-SQL-Exploration-

This Project contains SQL queries written to query a NYC property sales dataset from 2016-2017 to gain insight into which neighborhoods and borough are the most diserable to purchase various types of property. The dataset was aquired from kaggle.com, which was sourced from https://www1.nyc.gov that contains one table. The table contained 21 columns with information steming from tax code, building class, borough, and neighborhood.
